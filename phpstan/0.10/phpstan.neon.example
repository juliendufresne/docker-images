# This is just an example containing ALL the phpstan extension included in the
# docker image. Please report to the corresponding extension documentation for
# full configuration explanation.
# The only thing that differs from documentation is the path. Since you are in a
# docker container, extensions are not included in your project composer file
# but within the docker container. So when you see "vendor/" in documentation,
# you should use "/composer/vendor".

# paths correspond to ones in the phpstan container
